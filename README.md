# FlapLabel
Airport style display board components for Delphi Firemonkey. 
Simulates old mechanical flight information displays
(the ones with rolls of plates that change in sequence) 

FlapLabel was actually developed in 2002 for screens of 
SÃ£o Paulo Airport (Congonhas)  flight information displays, 
in substitution to old mechanical displays from Solari.
It is still in use in that airport.

The original components where for VCL. This is a port to FMX.
